**Calc-Z is a mobile calculator application built with Flutter, specifically designed for students and professionals in data-centric fields.** Say goodbye to scrambling for a laptop or complex spreadsheet software when you need to perform quick calculations on data lists or matrices. Calc-Z brings essential data manipulation capabilities right to your fingertips.

## üöÄ Features (Initial Scope)

Calc-Z aims to be your quick, on-the-go solution for data calculations. Here's what you can expect in the initial release:

* **Standard Calculator Functions:** All the basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) you'd expect from a regular calculator.
* **Variable Lists (`var` button):**
    * Define a variable (e.g., 'a', 'b', 'c') to represent a list of up to 20 numerical values.
    * Input values one by one, ideal for quick problem-solving in class.
    * Apply standard arithmetic formulas directly to these variable lists (e.g., `a^2`, `(a + 5) / 2`).
    * Outputs will be presented as a list of results.
* **Built-in Functions (`fn` button):**
    * Quickly perform common statistical operations on your variable lists like `sum()`, `mean()`, `median()`, `std_dev()`, `min()`, and `max()`.
* **Matrix Operations (`matrix` button):**
    * Define matrices (e.g., 'A', 'B', 'C') by specifying rows and columns and populating elements.
    * Perform fundamental matrix calculations:
        * Scalar Multiplication (e.g., `2 * A`)
        * Matrix Addition (`A + B`)
        * Matrix Subtraction (`A - B`)
        * Matrix Multiplication (`A * B`)
    * Error handling for dimension mismatches.
* **Intuitive UI:** Clean and straightforward interface for easy navigation and formula input.
* **Error Handling:** Clear messages for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero, non-matching matrix dimensions).

## ‚ú® Why Calc-Z?

In academic settings, or even during quick analysis sessions, opening up a spreadsheet or a statistical package for simple operations on small datasets can be overkill and time-consuming. Calc-Z fills this gap by providing:

* **Portability:** Perform calculations anywhere, anytime, directly from your mobile device.
* **Efficiency:** Quickly input and process data lists or matrices without complex setup.
* **Focus:** Designed with the needs of data students and professionals in mind, simplifying common data tasks.
* **No Internet Required:** Once installed, perform calculations offline.

## üì± Screenshots (Coming Soon!)

*(Once I have UI ready, this section will have actual screenshots of the app's key features: main calculator, variable input, matrix input, function menu, results display.)*

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Flutter:** For cross-platform mobile development (iOS & Android).
* **Dart:** The programming language.
